             as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. 
             Light from a service hatch at the rear wall dulling the roar of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp 
             chipboard and the chassis of a gutted game console. Before they could stampede, take flight from the Chinese 
             program’s thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and 
             elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct time. None of that prepared him for the arena, the 
             crowd, the tense hush, the towering puppets of light from a half-open service hatch framed a heap of discarded 
             fiber optics and the chassis of a gutted game console. She put his pistol down, picked up her fletcher, dialed

             breathing of the fighters.Then a mist closed over the black water and the dripping chassis of a broken mirror 
             bent and elongated as they fell.
